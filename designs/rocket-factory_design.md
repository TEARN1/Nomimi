## 1. Objectives
- Build a modular rocket factory and adjacent launch site capable of producing small orbital launch vehicles at an initial cadence of 6 builds/month.
- Deliverables: modular 3D factory model, engineering plan, safety and compliance checklist, Feasibility Report, timeline & issue backlog.

## 2. System Architecture
- Major subsystems: raw material intake & storage, propulsion module assembly, stage integration, avionics and wiring bay, composite fabrication, test stand, cleanrooms, control center, launchpad, logistics & shipping.
- Interfaces: mechanical mounting points, electrical power bus (3-phase + emergency), data network (industrial ethernet), hazardous material handling interfaces.

## 3. 3D Visualization Plan
- Assets: GLB/GLTF for factory shell, assembly lines, test stands, launchpad, representative vehicles.
- Thumbnail images for each asset and a manifest (assets/manifest.json) for the viewer.
- Annotation overlays: safety zones, evacuation routes, crane coverage, utility lines.

## 4. Engineering Breakdown
- Materials: structural steel for frames, carbon-fiber composite for payload fairings and tanks, aluminum alloys for fixtures.
- Power: estimated peak load 1-3 MW depending on production throughput; include backup generators and UPS for critical systems.
- Automation: robotic arms for stage stacking, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) for parts movement, CNCs for precision parts.

## 5. Standards & Compliance
- Applicable standards: local building codes, ISO 14644 (cleanrooms), OSHA-equivalent safety regulations, environmental permitting for launch operations.

## 6. Feasibility Analysis
- Risks: high energy consumption, hazardous propellant handling, launch licensing, local environmental impact.
- Unknowns: detailed throughput modeling, supply chain constraints, workforce training.

## 7. Action Items & GitHub Issues
- Create 3D assets placeholders and add to assets manifest.
- Implement simulation stubs for power and throughput.
- Draft safety and compliance checklist per local regulations.
- Create issue backlog for automation, facility design, and testing.
