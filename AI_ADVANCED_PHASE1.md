# Nomimi Advanced Architecture – Phase 1 Deliverables

This commit introduces the first wave of *foundational advanced modules* toward the 5000% evolution roadmap.

## Included Modules

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `orchestration_graph.py` | Dynamic DAG execution container (future: adaptive routing). |
| `telemetry_bus.py` | Central lightweight metrics & event collection. |
| `plugin_registry.py` | Declarative capability registration (future: manifests & signatures). |
| `semantic_knowledge_fabric.py` | Stub semantic index & fake embedding search. |
| `pareto_optimizer.py` | Simple multi-objective Pareto front calculator. |
| `constraint_formal_engine.py` | Formal constraint stub (future: SMT solver integration). |
| `ecology_engine.py` | Minimal closed-loop resource cycle model. |
| `chaos_injector.py` | Failure injection harness (future: scheduling, blast radius). |
| `explainability_graph.py` | Tracks decision lineage & dependencies. |
| `provenance_chain.py` | Hash-chained artifact ledger (future: signatures/Merkle). |
| `main_pipeline_advanced.py` | Demonstration wiring of Phase 1 modules. |

## New Route
`/advanced` – Executes the advanced orchestration demo (returns JSON structure inline for now).

## Next Recommended Steps (Phase 2 Candidates)
1. **Observability Expansion** – Export TelemetryBus to Prometheus / OpenTelemetry.
2. **Formal Engine Upgrade** – Integrate Z3 for real constraint proofs.
3. **Knowledge Fabric** – Replace fake embeddings with real vector store + provenance.
4. **Ecology Engine** – Add multi-species dynamics & resilience scoring.
5. **Distributed Orchestration** – Introduce async execution + failure rerouting.
6. **Explainability** – Add causal graph diff & counterfactual probes.
7. **Security/Provenance** – Digital signatures & tamper alerts.
8. **Chaos Integration** – Scheduled experiments + automatic resilience metrics.

## Usage
Run the flask app and visit:
```
python app.py
http://localhost:5000/advanced
```

## Verification Checklist
- Orchestration order is returned.
- Pareto front contains non-dominated designs.
- Constraints evaluation shows all_ok True.
- Explainability graph contains ecology_tick → options_generated → pareto_front → constraint_eval.
- Provenance chain verifies with intact hash links.

Phase 1 establishes the architectural *scaffolding* for adaptive intelligence, observability, formalism, and traceability. Subsequent phases will focus on depth, scale, and reliability.
