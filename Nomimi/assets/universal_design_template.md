# Universal AI Design & Planning Template (Nomimi Engine)

## Project Title
E.g., "Automated Rocket Factory for South Africa"

## 1. Objectives
- Clear mission statement for the project.
- Target outcomes (e.g., production capacity, safety, sustainability).

## 2. System Architecture
- Major subsystems/modules (e.g., propulsion, control, structure, environment).
- Block diagram or list of components.

## 3. 3D Visualization Plan
- 3D asset requirements (GLB/GLTF, modular parts).
- Key areas to visualize (factory floor, assembly line, control center, launchpad, etc.).
- Annotation requirements (safety, compliance, critical paths).

## 4. Engineering Breakdown
- Materials & technologies.
- Power, sensors, automation.
- Integration points and interfaces.

## 5. Standards & Compliance
- Relevant safety, environmental, and regulatory standards.
- Checklist for compliance and documentation.

## 6. Feasibility Analysis
- Current technological limits.
- Risk assessment.
- Real-world references and inspirations.

## 7. Action Items & GitHub Issues
- Suggested tasks/issues for collaboration.
- Links to subsystems, dependencies, contributors.

## 8. References
- Real-world systems, academic papers, patents.
- Asset sources (public libraries, GitHub repos, CAD files).
